## Database migrations

**IMPORTANT**: Run these migrations in Supabase Dashboard before deploying:

### 0039: Add Pro badge visibility
```sql
alter table public.app_users
add column if not exists show_pro_badge boolean not null default true;

comment on column public.app_users.show_pro_badge is
  'Whether the user wants to display their Pro badge publicly';
```

### 0040: Track trial usage
```sql
alter table public.app_users
add column if not exists has_used_trial boolean not null default false;

comment on column public.app_users.has_used_trial is
  'Whether the user has previously used their free trial';
```

### 0041: Fix premium subscription FK
```sql
-- Already exists in codebase, verify it's applied
```

## Stripe configuration

### âœ… Code-based trial (implemented)
The 7-day trial is configured programmatically in the checkout route:

**File**: `src/app/api/premium/checkout/route.ts` (line 172)
```typescript
subscription_data: {
  metadata,
  trial_period_days: 7,  // Automatic 7-day trial
},
```

**How it works**:
- All new checkouts automatically get a 7-day trial
- Payment method collected but not charged during trial
- After 7 days, Stripe charges $4.99/month
- Subscription status = "trialing" during trial
- Converts to "active" after trial ends

**No Stripe Dashboard configuration required!**

---

## Trial flow behavior

### For new users (trial eligible):
1. Click "Start free trial" button
2. Redirected to Stripe checkout (payment method required)
3. Subscription created with status "trialing"
4. Webhook marks `has_used_trial = true`
5. User sees "Pro member (trial)" status
6. Trial countdown banner shows expiration date
7. After 7 days: Auto-charged $4.99/month, status becomes "active"

### For returning users (trial used):
1. Click "Start free trial" button
2. Checkout blocks with message: "You've already used your free trial. You can still subscribe for $4.99/month."
3. User can still subscribe at regular price

### Cancellation during trial:
- User cancels â†’ No charge
- Access ends immediately
- `has_used_trial` remains `true` (cannot get another trial)

---

## Deployment steps

### 1. Pre-deployment (local)
- [x] Run `npm run build` - Build passes âœ…
- [x] Run `npm run typecheck` - No errors âœ…
- [x] Review git changes
- [x] Test in dev mode (`npm run dev`)

### 2. Database migrations (Supabase Dashboard)
**IMPORTANT: Run BEFORE deploying code**

1. Log into Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run migration 0039 (add show_pro_badge column)
4. Run migration 0040 (add has_used_trial column)
5. Verify columns exist: `select show_pro_badge, has_used_trial from app_users limit 1;`

### 3. Code deployment (Vercel)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add Pro rebranding and 7-day trial"
git push origin feat/pro
```

Vercel will auto-deploy from the push.

### 4. Post-deployment verification
1. Visit production site
2. Check ProTab loads correctly
3. Test trial signup flow (use Stripe test mode)
4. Verify webhook receives "trialing" status
5. Check account page shows trial UI
6. Verify existing Pro members unaffected

### 5. Monitoring (first 24 hours)
- Watch Vercel logs for errors
- Monitor Stripe Dashboard for new trials
- Check Supabase logs for webhook activity
- Verify badge visibility toggles work

---

## Environment variables

**No new environment variables required!**

All existing variables remain unchanged:
- `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` - Same price, trial added via code
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Unchanged
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Unchanged
- `SUPABASE_*` - Unchanged

---

## Rollback plan

If issues arise, rollback is straightforward:

### Code rollback:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin feat/pro
```

### Database rollback:
```sql
-- Remove trial tracking
alter table public.app_users drop column if exists has_used_trial;

-- Remove badge visibility
alter table public.app_users drop column if exists show_pro_badge;
```

**Note**: This will lose badge visibility preferences for existing users.

---

## Known limitations

### Deferred features (from original plan)
These features are **not implemented** in this deployment:

1. **Badge display in leaderboards** - ProBadge component ready, but not integrated into:
   - Leaderboard tables
   - Search results
   - Replay listings
   - Match history

   **Reason**: Requires batch data fetching and page-specific integration.
   **Helper ready**: `getBatchProBadgeStatus()` in `src/lib/pro-badge.ts`

2. **Annual billing option** - Not implemented
3. **Referral program** - Not implemented
4. **Team subscriptions** - Not implemented

### Future enhancements
- Badge customization (colors/styles)
- Pro analytics dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Comparative stats vs other Pro members

---

## Success metrics to track

### Trial conversion
- Number of trial signups per week
- Trial â†’ Paid conversion rate (target: >40%)
- Trial cancellation reasons (if collected)

### Badge usage
- % of Pro members showing badges
- Badge click-through rate to /pro page

### Revenue impact
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) growth
- Average revenue per user (ARPU)
- Churn rate

### User engagement
- Time spent on ProTab
- Clicks on "Start free trial" CTA
- Account page visits

---

## Support considerations

### Common user questions

**Q: I already used my trial, can I get another one?**
A: No, the free trial is a one-time offer. You can subscribe for $4.99/month.

**Q: When will I be charged?**
A: You'll be charged $4.99/month after your 7-day free trial ends.

**Q: How do I cancel during the trial?**
A: Go to Account page â†’ "Manage Pro membership" â†’ Cancel subscription. You won't be charged.

**Q: Can I hide my Pro badge?**
A: Yes! Go to Account page â†’ "Pro badge visibility" section â†’ Toggle off.

**Q: What happens if I cancel?**
A: Your analytics data remains in our database. If you resubscribe, everything will still be there.

## Technical notes

### Badge system architecture
- Badge status cached in account session (via AccountProvider)
- Batch fetching helpers available for leaderboards (not yet integrated)
- Badge visibility stored per-user in `app_users.show_pro_badge`
- Badge click links to ProTab (not standalone /pro page)

### Trial tracking
- `has_used_trial` flag prevents multiple trials
- Flag set by webhook when subscription status = "trialing"
- Checked in checkout route before creating session
- Displayed in UI via session API

### Subscription statuses
- `"trialing"` - During 7-day trial
- `"active"` - Paid subscription active
- `"past_due"` - Payment failed but still active
- `"canceled"` - Subscription ended

All three (`trialing`, `active`, `past_due`) grant Pro access.
