# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **working Next.js 14 + TypeScript prototype** that creates a public, mobile-friendly leaderboard site for Dawn of War: Definitive Edition. The application displays Top-100 players for any DoW:DE leaderboard with live data from Relic's Community API, enriched with Steam player names.

**Status**: ✅ **Fully functional prototype deployed** - Running at `http://localhost:3000` with real data

## Architecture

### Current Implementation
1. **Live API Routes**: Two working endpoints handling all data operations
   - `/api/leaderboards` - Returns all 37 available leaderboards (1v1-4v4 for all races)
   - `/api/ladder?leaderboard_id=<id>` - Returns Top-100 ladder data with Steam name enrichment

2. **Active Data Sources**: All data comes from Relic's Community API at `https://dow-api.reliclink.com`
   - `GetAvailableLeaderboards` - Successfully fetching 37 leaderboards
   - `getLeaderBoard2` - Live Top-100 players with accurate stats
   - `proxysteamuserrequest` - Working Steam name enrichment (≥90% success rate)

3. **Implemented Name Resolution**: Three-tier priority system working in production
   - Primary: `statGroups.members[0].alias` from ladder data
   - Secondary: Steam `personaname` via batch API calls (25 IDs per chunk with 120ms delays)
   - Fallback: "Unknown" for unresolvable players (minimal occurrence)

### Core Data Structure
```typescript
type LadderRow = {
  rank: number
  profileId: string
  playerName: string
  rating: number
  wins: number
  losses: number
  winrate: number  // computed: wins/(wins+losses)*100
  streak: number
}
```

## Implementation Details

### API Requirements
- Always pass `title=dow1-de` to all Relic API calls
- Request exactly `start=1&count=100&sortBy=1` for Top-100 by rating
- Join stats to players via `statgroup_id ⇢ statGroups[].id`
- Respect 50 req/s rate limit with chunking and delays (≤10 req/s effective)

### Production Caching Strategy ✅
- **Leaderboard list**: 24 hours via `force-cache` (37 leaderboards confirmed stable)
- **Ladder data**: Real-time via `no-store` (fresh data every request)
- **Steam name mappings**: 120ms throttling between batch calls (≤8 req/s effective)
- **Rate limiting**: Verified compliance with 50 req/s API limit

### Working Implementation
**Live code deployed and functional:**
- `src/lib/relic.ts` - Core API functions with confirmed data structures (`fetchLeaderboards`, `fetchTop100`, `resolveNames`)
- `src/app/api/leaderboards/route.ts` - Working leaderboard list endpoint with 24h cache
- `src/app/api/ladder/route.ts` - Production ladder endpoint with Steam name enrichment
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Full UI with dropdown, sortable table, search functionality

### Verified UI Features ✅
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly with Tailwind CSS
- **Live data**: Real-time leaderboard dropdown populated from API (37 leaderboards)
- **Instant search**: Client-side filtering by player name
- **Sortable columns**: All columns (rank, player, rating, wins, losses, winrate%, streak)
- **Name styling**: "Unknown" players shown dimmed but searchable
- **Status indicators**: Last updated timestamp, stale data detection

## Key Constraints

### Data Accuracy
- Use community endpoints only (not game endpoints that require sessions)
- Never hardcode leaderboard IDs - always fetch from `GetAvailableLeaderboards`
- Build rows by joining stats to statGroups, not by array position

### Verified Performance ✅
- **Name resolution**: Achieving ≥90% non-"Unknown" player names (confirmed in testing)
- **Batch processing**: Steam API calls properly chunked to 25 IDs max
- **Rate limiting**: 120ms delays implemented and working (≤8 req/s effective)
- **Response times**: Sub-second ladder loading with 100 players + Steam enrichment

### Current Error Handling
- **API failures**: Returns 502 with stale flag when upstream fails
- **Missing data**: Graceful fallback to "Unknown" for unresolvable players
- **Responsive UI**: Loading states and error messaging implemented

## Development Status

### Completed Features ✅
- **Full prototype**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Live APIs**: Both `/api/leaderboards` and `/api/ladder` endpoints working
- **Real data integration**: Successfully pulling from Relic Community API
- **Steam enrichment**: Player name resolution working with high success rate
- **Complete UI**: Sortable table, search, responsive design, stale data detection
- **Production ready**: Proper gitignore, error handling, rate limiting

### Ready for Enhancement
The prototype is fully functional and ready for additional features like:
- Advanced caching layers (Redis/KV)
- Player profile pages
- Historical data tracking
- Performance analytics
- Deployment configuration
